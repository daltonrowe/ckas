  The Central Kentucky Audubon Society is a member of the <a href="https://www.audubon.org/" target="_blank">National Audubon Society</a> and the <a href="http://www.kentuckyauduboncouncil.org/" target="_blank">Kentucky Audubon Council</a>, and serves ten central Kentucky counties in the promotion of conservation education and awareness.

  The Chapter originally took the name Buckley Hills Audubon Society from Clyde E. and Emma Buckley, who founded the Clyde E. Buckley Wildlife Sanctuary in Frankfort, Kentucky. Read more about the history of the Sanctuary, the Chapter, and National Audubon Society on our <a href="about.html">About Us</a> page. In 2014, Buckley Hills officially changed its name to Central Kentucky Audubon to more accurately reflect the area we serve.
